## clutering

contains code for different clustering

The main programs only output the onjectives and accuracy. plotting is done by a separate program.

There are also some visualizations of the results in there.



## PCA:

contains files for PCA

Code is separated for the 2d dataset and 1000d dataset. But the code are mostly the same other than the parts that
are specific to the questions and the dataset.

DRO for 1000d also analyzes and generates the optimal dimension to reduce to for that dataset.
